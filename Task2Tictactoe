Task 2: tictactoe.sh

Create a script that would read the user input in the form [x,y] coordinates where 1=< x =<3 and 1=< y =<3 and draw the tic-tac-toe game.
-	Screen should be cleared before you redraw it.
-	The game is played against the computer AI that generates random coordinates each turn 
		[x=$((1 + RANDOM % 3)) and y=$((1 + RANDOM % 3))]
-	Human and AI Players can’t input a coordinate that has already been played. [Ask for another coordinate if this happens]
-	Human and AI Players can’t input invalid inputs. [Ask for another coordinate if this happens]
-	The game should detect when a player wins when 3 marks are one the same line [vertical, horizontal or diagonal]
	and output “PLAYER ? [?] WINS!!!!”
-	The game should detect when all slots are filled and it’s a tie game and output a message “Losers :D”
